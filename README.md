Malt.io Website
===============
This is an experimental project for the new Malt.io website. More to come soon.

Getting Started
---------------
First, clone this repository. Make sure you have Node.js installed, and then install Grunt if you don't already have it:

```bash
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Then, install the build dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now you're ready to run the site!

```bash
grunt
```

The site is now running at http://localhost:9000/
